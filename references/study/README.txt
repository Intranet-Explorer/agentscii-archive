What this is: a 23-artist collaborative ANSI scroll, DemoSplash 2013
ANSi/ASCII compo winner, one of the most-viewed ANSi pieces ever made.
80 columns wide, ~3325 rows tall when rendered (one continuous vertical
scroll built from ~775 logical lines that wrap at 80 cols, plus explicit
CRLF breaks — page through it in ~80-row chunks via preview_piece).

Why it's here: this is the technique reference for the house "Ambition
tier" in STYLE.md — study it for real craft, not to copy it panel-for-
panel. Look at:
  - how color-cycling dithering actually reads at a distance vs up close
  - how panels hand off into each other (no jarring hard cuts)
  - density and intentionality — very few cells are "wasted" flat fill
  - how a border/frame motif repeats and varies across a very long scroll
  - how multiple contributors' sections stay visually coherent as one
    piece despite 23 different hands

Files in this folder:
  - we-ACiDTrip.ANS -- the flagship deep-dive reference (see above). 3325-row
    scroll, panel handoffs, color-cycling dithering, a real demon/creature
    face (study @ row 2160) with gradient-built anatomical shading.
  - somms-neo_tokyo.ANS -- "Neo Tokyo" by Somms, ACiD Productions 1994. A
    muscular figure built entirely from shaded block regions -- study for
    how much anatomical structure (shoulder, chest, arm definition) a
    disciplined light-source + density-ramp pass can carry with NO gradient
    math, just careful hand-placed block-density choices per region. Uses
    real cursor-addressing (ESC[A, cursor-forward jumps) to layer shading
    onto rows already drawn -- this is THE technique gap the house has been
    missing: real ACiD work is rarely drawn top-to-bottom once, it's built
    in passes that go back and add detail.
  - ghengis_ragnarok-ides_of_march.ANS -- "Ides of March" by Ghengis &
    Ragnarok, ACiD Productions 1995. A two-artist joint character portrait
    (chick drawn by Ghengis, rest by Ragnarok per the piece's own credits)
    with genuinely dense per-feature shading: individually shaded strands
    of hair, jewelry with metallic highlight/shadow pairs, a fully
    constructed face with brow/cheek/jaw as separate lit surfaces. Also
    relies heavily on cursor-up layering -- study how the piece interleaves
    base color blocks with later highlight passes.
  - asphyx-acid_logo.ANS -- "ACiD" by Asphyx, ACiD Productions 2003. A
    wordmark/logo piece with a face built INTO the negative space of the
    lettering -- study for how a logo piece can carry real figurative
    content instead of being flat typography, and for dense background
    texture (this piece has almost no unshaded negative space anywhere).
  - nokturnal_emissions-millenium_edition.ANS -- "Millenium Edition" by
    Nokturnal Emissions, ACiD Productions 2003. A genie/creature face with
    a fully rendered horned head, individually shaded beard/mustache
    strands, and a dense patterned border framing a credits panel below --
    study for panel structure (art zone + separate text zone, both fully
    developed) and for background texture density around a figure (compare
    against how flat/empty the house's own figurative pieces leave their
    negative space).
  - ghengis-shades_of_a_shade.ANS -- "Shades of a Shade" by Ghengis, ACiD
    Productions 1996. Study for DENSE STIPPLED BACKGROUND FIELDS: even the
    areas that read as "empty" at a glance are covered in scattered
    grayscale dot/block marks at varying density, never truly flat black --
    this is the single biggest technique gap between house work and real
    ACiD pieces. Also a strong reference for saturated color blocking with
    hard-edged color transitions (not always gradient blends).
  - somms-the_powergrid.ANS -- "The PowerGrid" by Somms, ACiD Productions
    1995. Study for DIRECTIONAL STRAND SHADING: fur/mane/hair texture isn't
    a flat-shaded region, it's built from many short strokes that follow
    the surface's contour, alternating between 2-4 related hues per area
    so individual strands stay visually distinct instead of blurring into
    one flat mass. See canvas.py's strand_shade() for a reusable version
    of this technique.
  - avg-theterminator.ans -- a character portrait via SHADED BLOCK REGIONS
    (not per-cell gradient math) -- a different, equally valid technique for
    building a recognizable face: broad color-region blocking with internal
    shading transitions, plus a real title-card wordmark top and bottom.
  - del-jaws.ans -- a scene composition: wordmark banner, gradient-shaded
    water, a submerged silhouette shape rising into frame, a tagline caption.
    Good reference for landscape/scene pieces with a clear focal subject.
  - we-One_love.ans -- a longer (150-row) piece combining a character
    portrait with a logo treatment -- study for how a figure and a wordmark
    share one composition without either one looking like an afterthought.
  - acdu1190_1.ans, bt_acidtrip_1.ans (+ critique), bt_what-happened-with-
    luciano-ayres.ans -- earlier-gathered study files, kept for reference.

NOTE on cursor-addressing (ESC[A / ESC[B / ESC[row;colH): several of the
newer references above use this real classic-scene technique -- draw a base
layer, then move the cursor back to an already-drawn row to add highlights,
shadows, or fine detail on top, rather than getting every cell right in one
top-to-bottom pass. preview_piece's renderer (harness.py) was fixed to
actually support this (a real row/col cursor model, not a flat per-line
parser) -- before the fix, any piece using this technique rendered as
diagonal garbage. If a preview ever looks like torn/streaked static instead
of a coherent image, that's a real render bug worth flagging, not a broken
reference file.

All downloaded raw from 16colo.rs (raw/ endpoint, unmodified source bytes).
Same rule as before: study technique, don't reproduce or resubmit any of
these as house work. If you want more variety than what's here, more real
Blocktronics/ACiD packs exist at 16colo.rs/group/blocktronics -- pull
additional individual pieces via curl if a specific technique gap calls
for a specific reference (e.g. "I want to see how a real piece handles X").

Added 2026-09-15, from two Blocktronics pack releases Tyler named directly:
16colo.rs/pack/blocktronics-20th-century-blocks and
16colo.rs/pack/blocktronics-dsotb. Note: the DSOTB pack has several pieces
depicting existing licensed characters (film/TV/game); those were
deliberately NOT pulled into this corpus (same call as excluding the
pin-up piece earlier) -- the six below are all original work.

  - blocktronics-tnt_bl0b.ANS -- "BL0B" by TNT, 20th Century Blocks (2020).
    An 830-row vertical scroll, dense red/black abstract panel work with a
    real recurring frame motif across the whole length. Strong second
    reference for the house "Ambition tier" scroll technique alongside
    we-ACiDTrip.ANS -- study panel transitions and how density stays high
    across a very long piece without going flat partway through.
  - blocktronics-avg_fadingblack.ANS -- "Fading Black" by AVG, DSOTB (2019).
    A genuinely gradient-shaded portrait (not block-region shading like
    somms-neo_tokyo.ANS) -- real per-cell density variation carrying skin
    tone, hair, and directional light across a face. Closest reference in
    this corpus to what figure_common.py's shade()/light_field() is trying
    to produce -- study this one directly if a figurative piece isn't
    reading as lit 3D form.
  - blocktronics-del_impulse.ANS -- "Impulse Project" by DEL, DSOTB (2019).
    Compact abstract/geometric piece, dithered block shapes in cyan/green
    on black, plus a clean small-scale logo/URL treatment at the bottom --
    reference for how a short, simple piece still carries real texture and
    doesn't need scroll-scale ambition to be well-made.
  - blocktronics-mx_mess.ANS -- "Block Tronics" by MX, DSOTB (2019). Dense
    ornamental/psychedelic scrollwork -- ropes of color-cycling curled line
    patterns, symmetric mirrored ornamentation, ANSI-art calligraphy for
    the wordmark. Reference for pure abstract/decorative density and
    color-cycling technique distinct from both the figurative and
    scroll-narrative references already here.
  - blocktronics-hx_night.ANS -- "42020" by HX, DSOTB (2019). Another long
    (900-row) abstract scroll, dense red/gray dithered geometric fields --
    a second data point on scroll-scale abstract work (distinct palette
    and texture approach from tnt_bl0b.ANS) alongside the figurative/
    narrative scrolls already in this folder.
  - blocktronics-n_silove.ANS -- "silove" by N, DSOTB (2019). Original
    wordmark/graffiti-style logo piece with a drip/paint-run texture
    technique on the lettering -- reference for logo/wordmark work
    specifically, a tradition STYLE.md names but this corpus was
    otherwise thin on.

Added 2026-09-15 (second batch), from 16colo.rs/pack/blocktronics_16colors
(2013) and 16colo.rs/pack/blocktr0nics30302020 (2020). Same standard as
before: several candidates reviewed and excluded before adding these --
one depicting a licensed film franchise, one pin-up/cheesecake-style piece
off-brief regardless of origin, one ambiguous multi-artist collage with
unclear individual provenance, one with a character-suggestive filename.
The five below are confirmed original technique-focused work.

  - blocktronics-avg_16c.ANS -- by AVG, 16colors pack (2013). A painted
    portrait/creature study using genuine photorealistic multi-hue color
    transitions (not the house's usual single-hue density ramp) --
    reference for figure_common.photoreal_gradient().
  - blocktronics-zo_16cdraw.ANS -- by zO, 16colors pack (2013). Original
    mutant/creature illustration with constructed mouth/teeth anatomy and
    dense gradient shading -- another figurative reference alongside
    somms-neo_tokyo.ANS and we-ACiDTrip.ANS's row-2160 creature.
  - blocktronics-we_c22.ANS -- by Sudden Death (outline) & Knocturnal
    (shading), 16colors pack (2013). Metallic/mechanical object with real
    specular highlights (tight bright cores distinct from the broader
    diffuse shading) -- reference for figure_common.specular_shade().
  - blocktronics-biz_collo.ANS -- by BIZ, 16colors pack (2013). Original
    graffiti-style wordmark lettering, a different letterform style than
    n_silove.ANS -- second logo/wordmark reference.
  - blocktronics-ra_mindseye.ANS -- "Mind's Eye" by RA, 30302020 pack
    (2020). Abstract swirl composition with genuine specular highlight
    technique (tight gloss cores on curved forms) -- second reference for
    figure_common.specular_shade() alongside we_c22.ANS.
