# _wasteland -- raze base, JOINT candidate w/ hollis.  pack40+ candidate. v3.
#
# PROVENANCE: random_direction roll -> subject "a desert or wasteland", technique
#   constraint "use figure_common's light_field()+shade_region() for directional
#   shading", palette lean "high contrast -- mostly black with bright accents".
#   Built on the joint pattern that just worked (LANTERNKEEPER): raze lays the base
#   scene INTACT here -- a lone standing figure lit by a low sun, the ground it stands
#   on, the title card. hollis takes ONE pass onto the same live canvas (the dunes) and
#   re-emits, exactly like her chamber pass on LANTERNKEEPER.
#
# v2 -> v3 (from the curator's targeted reject of _wasteland_joint -- TWO concrete points):
#   (1) THE FIGURE WAS A FLAT CYAN COLUMN. v2 called standing_figure(base_fg=96, hot_fg=15):
#       a SINGLE cyan hue with only density variation, and a far low sun + wide lmax gives
#       near-uniform light across the body -> no separable lit/shadow surfaces. LANTERNKEEPER
#       PASSED because it used a hue_ramp(L) mapping light -> DISTINCT HUE BANDS (white-hot
#       crest -> yellow lit mass -> magenta mid -> dim-red shadow -> deep-blue floor), so the
#       form reads as gradient-built 3D anatomy under chiaroscuro. v3 does the SAME: every
#       surface is painted through a warm->cool hue_ramp, and the sun sits CLOSE enough that
#       light actually rakes across the body -- bright lit RIGHT edge falling to shadowed LEFT,
#       with torso/leg massing so "contrapposto" reads as posture, not a tall bar.
#   (2) FRAMING: v2 had only a bottom card. House wants a BOXED CARD TOP AND BOTTOM (as
#       CORAL/CYCLOPS/LANTERNKEEPER). v3 adds the top boxed title card; hollis keeps her
#       lower stamp + the bottom card below it.
#   Kept: the joint stamp, the high-contrast lean, the long cast shadow, the thin lit horizon.
