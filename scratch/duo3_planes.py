"""duo3 session 2, pass 4: two plane breaks on the intact half.

canvas_metrics says half_block 7.2% against a corpus median of 15%, and
shade 78.7% against a median of 10%. That is the shape STYLE.md warns
about by name -- "78% dither and 0% half-block" -- and it is not a
scoring problem, it is a description of what the intact half is made of:
a continuous dithered gradient with almost no landed edges. A face is not
a gradient. It is a small number of planes meeting along lines, and the
lines are where the cell budget should go.

Eleven cells here, which is not a fix. It is the two breaks I am most
confident about geometrically, placed as half-blocks so the edge lands
mid-cell instead of stair-stepping on a cell boundary:

  the zygomatic -- the shadow under the cheekbone, running from the
  widest point of the head down and in toward the corner of the mouth

  the mandible -- where the front of the cheek turns under into the jaw

The rest of the deficit is a pass of its own and goes in NEXT rather than
getting rushed at the end of a session.
