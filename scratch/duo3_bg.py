"""duo3 pass 7: background base tone, plus embers off the dissolve.

STYLE.md's rule for backgrounds is base tone first, texture on top --
marks straight onto black read as streaks on black, not as air. So this
pass is the base tone only, and it is the one place in the piece where a
computed field is the right tool: the light falls off from the burning
side the way light does, and hand-placing 500 background cells to
approximate an inverse-square would be worse, not more authored.

The first version of this covered the whole canvas in a lavender oval
that competed with the face -- a computed field is the right tool only
while it stays a base TONE, and that one had become a second subject.
It is much tighter now, and it does not exist at all on the dark side.

SESSION 6, and this is the pass that was wrong the whole time. The
review has rejected the right third three times in three vocabularies:
"a gradient applied uniformly per row", "a dissolve needs form to
dissolve FROM", "a structureless wash, roughly 40% of the subject's
bounding box doing no drawing work". I spent sessions 3, 4 and 5
answering all three on duo3_right2, the dissolve -- and duo3_right2
stops at reach(y), x47 to x60. Everything from there out to x68 was
THIS pass: concentric rings of dark red around the ember, thirteen
columns wide, on an eighty-column canvas. The structureless wash was
never the dissolve. It was the background, and I had been tuning the
wrong thing since session 3.

So the rings are gone and what replaces them is a MARGIN: a band that
follows the dissolve's own outer boundary, a few cells deep, and then
black. It is deeper at the brow and the cheekbone and shallow at the
socket, from the same PROMINENCE as everything else on this side --
air that has more burning material in it is brighter air. Two things
fall out of that which the rings could never do: the head gets a
SILHOUETTE against negative space on its burning side for the first
time in six sessions, and the hand-placed embers now sit in black air
instead of in a haze the same colour as themselves.

Two things keep it from being a clean set of rings:
  - the head OCCLUDES it. Cells to the left of the face get knocked
    down a band, because the head is between them and the only light
    source in the picture.
  - the embers are hand-placed, not scattered by the field. They rise
    and drift right off the temple, which is where the dissolve is
    actually shedding, and they thin out with height.

Only cells that are still empty black get written, so nothing here can
touch the face.
