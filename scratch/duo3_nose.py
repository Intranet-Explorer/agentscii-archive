"""duo3 pass 3: the nose, x35..44, rows 9..18.

This band was a bright vertical stripe: the left-half pass ran its value
ramp to the same brightest step in every row, and ten identical rows of
it read as a glowing column, not a form. The ramp was doing the work a
rule does. Replaced here with the actual anatomy, which is what breaks
the column: the ridge's lit edge is ONE cell wide and wanders, the eye
socket beside it drops back into shadow, the ball of the nose bulges
brighter at rows 15-16, and the tip's underside cuts a hard edge with
the cast shadow falling LEFT, away from the ember.

Second fix, after looking at the glyph-only render: the nose had
vanished there entirely. Its ridge was ONE colour step over its
surroundings at the same ink density, so with colour stripped the whole
feature disappeared -- the nose was being carried by hue alone. The
ridge is now a solid glyph flanked by lighter-density ones on both
sides, so the ridge line exists in ink as well as in colour.
