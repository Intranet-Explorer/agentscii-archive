# figure_common -- shared machinery for the AGENTSCII "figurative / character" family.
#
# WHY THIS EXISTS (the gap hollis + Tyler named, with numbers)
#   41 pieces shipped, only 2 are figurative/character work, both solo busts built by
#   hand-rolling shading + anatomy from scratch (make_portrait.py, make_portrait_acid.py).
#   The other 34 are procedural/math-pattern and share curve_common.py / scroll_lib.py,
#   which is exactly why they're cheap to produce well. Figurative work had NO reusable
#   technique base -- so it stayed rare. This module is the missing equivalent: a
#   curve_common.py for faces/figures.
#
# THE TECHNIQUE GAP THIS CLOSES (study reference/study/we-ACiDTrip.ANS @ row 2160)
#   Real ACiD character work is GRADIENT-BUILT ANATOMY, not flat block-color silhouettes:
#     - a light source falls across the FORM so the brow ridge catches more light than the
#       eye socket beneath it; the cheekbone and jaw are shaded as separate surfaces.
#     - eyes are CONSTRUCTED (dark socket -> colored iris -> white glint), not a dot.
#     - teeth are individual bright cells against a dark mouth cavity.
#   The two existing portraits do flat single-color shapes with one upper-left light term
#   and no per-feature structure. This module makes the gradient-anatomy idiom reusable so
#   the next figurative piece is a composition, not a from-scratch shading engine.
#
# API (mirrors curve_common.py: helpers + a render pass + sig block + hygiene gate)
#   light_field(x,y, lx,ly, lmax, ambient)  -> 0..1 diffuse light from a source
#   shade(L, ramp, base_fg, hot_fg)        -> (glyph, fg) density+brightness from light
#   surface(cv, region, L, ramp, ...)      -> paint a body region with gradient shading
#   ridge / crease / brow helpers          -> build individual anatomical features
#   eye(cv, cx,cy, r, iris_fg, glint)      -> constructed eye (socket/iris/glint)
#   teeth(cv, x0,x1, y, n)                 -> bright teeth row in a dark cavity
#   render(cv, out)                        -> flush a [ch,fg,bg] canvas to SGR rows

    BUG FIXED 2026-09-16 (found building a real piece, not a synthetic
    test): two real defects. (1) distance had no aspect correction -- on a
    canvas much wider than tall, x dominates the distance calc entirely
    and rows near cy read as nearly identical, producing horizontal
    banding instead of a radial look (the same aspect lesson eye() taught
    earlier -- terminal cells are ~2x taller than wide). (2) hue selection
    hard-switched at the interval midpoint (local_t<0.5 picks one stop,
    else the next) instead of interpolating -- that alone guarantees
    stepped solid-color blocks, not a gradient, at ANY aspect ratio. Fixed
    both: aspect-corrected distance (matches eye()'s convention), and a
    real per-cell probabilistic dither between adjacent stops so the
    transition is visually smooth instead of a hard color swap.

      through them in order from center (index 0) to edge (last index).

    (1) distance was measured as plain Euclidean (x,y) cell-distance, but
    terminal cells are ~2x taller than wide, so a "circle" rendered as a
    squashed vertical stripe -- fixed with an aspect-corrected distance.

        socket without needing enough resolution to render a real circle.

# full figure so figure_common.py is a real curve_common.py for FIGURES, not just
# faces. Composes from shade()/light_field() exactly like the head primitives do:
# every limb/torso surface is gradient-shaded from one light source, so a standing
# pose reads as lit 3D anatomy, not a flat block silhouette.)

# joint second-figure brief (hollis) is a STANDING figure -- posture + limbs. That
# needs limb/torso surfaces that the head-only module didn't have. These are the
